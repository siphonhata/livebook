## Data Types

```elixir
# All data types in Elixir are immutable(constants).
```

## Atom

```elixir
# A constant whose value is its own name
# Atoms are great for sending messages and representing constants
:nike

{:error, reason} = {:error, "File not found"}

# Above is a practical example of how an atom
# can be used to return or show error message 
# an application may come across in runtime.
```

## Strings

```elixir
# Strings are just array of characters
```
